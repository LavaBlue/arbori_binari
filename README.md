SDA__BinarySearchTrees_API_proposal

Basically this is a proposal of a BST API.
It supports my current lecture activity @ Electronics, Telecommunications and IT faculty, within UPB (Politehnica in Bucharest).

What it should contain:
- insertion
- deletions
- traversals
- tree height computation
- balancing.

TODO:
- add balancing computation (fully)
- eventually: rotations (and AVL trees).
